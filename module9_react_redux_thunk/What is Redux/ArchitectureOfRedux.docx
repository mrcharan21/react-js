1. State

State is an initialized data object that holds information about the app’s current status.

It can be updated when user interactions or actions occur.

In React, each component can have its own local state, but Redux provides a global state that can be shared across multiple components.

State is used to store and manage dynamic data that changes over time.

Example:

const initialState = { count: 0 };

✅ 2. UI (User Interface)

UI stands for User Interface — it’s what the user sees and interacts with in the application.

In React + Redux, the UI (React components) is connected to the Redux store to display and update data.

When a user interacts with the UI (for example, submitting a form), an action is dispatched to the store to update the state.

Example Flow:
UI → Dispatch Action → Reducer → Update State → UI Rerenders

✅ 3. Actions

Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application.

Each action must have a type property that defines the action’s purpose, and it can include a payload containing additional data.

Actions are dispatched from the UI and read by reducers to update the state.

Actions are not functions — they are simple objects that describe an intention to change state.

Example:

const addTodo = {
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: 'Learn Redux'
};

✅ 4. Reducer

A Reducer is a pure function that determines how the state should change in response to an action.

It takes two arguments: the current state and an action, and returns a new state.

Reducers must be pure — they don’t modify the existing state directly or perform side effects.

They act as the “decision maker” for updating the store.

Example:

function todoReducer(state = [], action) {
  if (action.type === 'ADD_TODO') {
    return [...state, action.payload];
  }
  return state;
}

✅ 5. Store

The Store is the central place where the entire state of your application is stored.

It acts as the brain of Redux, managing how state updates and how components access data.

The store is created using the createStore() or (modern way) configureStore() method from Redux Toolkit.

It connects the actions, reducers, and the UI together.

Example:

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import todoReducer from './todoReducer';

const store = configureStore({ reducer: todoReducer });

Concept	Description
State -->	Holds the app’s data and can be updated when actions occur.
UI -->	User Interface that interacts with the Redux store to show and update data.
Action -->Plain object describing what happened; dispatched from UI.
Reducer -->	Pure function that updates the state based on the action type.
Store --> Central place that holds the global state and connects actions + reducers.
