What is Redux ?
1.Redux is a javascript library (not limited to react) used for state management.
  -- It helps manage and centralize the applications state in a predicatable way.

2.Redux provides a robust architecture suitable for complex applications.
  -- It helps organize data flow in large-scale projects by followinf a predictable pattern.

3.Redux is used to store and manage application data(State).
  -- The global store keeps all the app's state in one central place.

4.Redux is used to load,update and synchronize data through a predicatable state management system.

5.Redux is not part of React itself, but it is commonly used with react for managing global state.
    -- we install it using packages like redux and react-redux

6.Redux provides a "store" -- a central container where all state us stored.

7.Redux uses "actions" and "reducers" to define how data changes.
        -actions describe what happened.
        -Reducers specify how the state chnages in response to actions.
    
8.Redux uses "dispatch" to send actions to the store, which updates the state through reducers.

9.Redux allows React components to read data from the Redux store using the useSelector hook.

10. Redux supports midddleware like (redux-thunk) or (redux-saga) to handle asynchronous logic such as API calls.
    
Redux provides a  life cycle architectures 
1.  state
2. ui
3. actions
4. Reducer (simple generalised function)
5. store
