package.json is a file that contains metadata about the project, including its dependencies, scripts, and other configurations. It is essential for managing the project's packages and versions.

When you run `npm install`, it reads the package.json file to determine which packages to install and their respective versions. It also creates a `node_modules` directory where all the installed packages are stored.

when package json is deleted then node_modules is also deleted

if package.json is deleted then we can not run the project
so we can create a package.json -lock will help us to create a package.json file again.
