What is json?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is primarily used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.
JSON is language-independent, but it uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, which includes C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. This makes JSON an ideal data format for data interchange in web applications.
JSON is often used in AJAX requests to send and receive data from a server. It is also commonly used in APIs to provide a structured way to exchange data between different systems.
JSON data is represented as key-value pairs, similar to how objects are defined in JavaScript. It can represent complex data structures, including arrays and nested objects.

JSON syntax is simple and consists of the following basic elements:
- **Objects**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Each key is a string, followed by a colon `:`, and then the value. Multiple key-value pairs are separated by commas.
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
  }
  ```
- **Arrays**: An ordered collection of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Values can be of any type, including objects, strings, numbers, and other arrays. Values are separated by commas.
  ```json
  [
    "apple",
    "banana",
    "cherry"
  ]
  ```

- **Values**: Can be strings (enclosed in double quotes), numbers, objects, arrays, booleans (`true` or `false`), or `null`.
  ```json
  {
    "isActive": true,
    "balance": 250.75,
    "address": null
  }
  ```
- **Strings**: Must be enclosed in double quotes and can contain Unicode characters, escape sequences, and special characters.
  ```json
  {
    "greeting": "Hello, world!"
  }
  ```
- **Numbers**: Can be integers or floating-point numbers, and do not require quotes.
  ```json
  {
    "age": 25,
    "height": 5.9
  }
  ```
- **Booleans**: Represented as `true` or `false` without quotes.
  ```json
  {
    "isStudent": false
  }
  ```
- **Null**: Represents an empty value and is written as `null` without quotes.
  ```json
  {
    "middleName": null
  }
  ```
JSON is widely used in web development for its simplicity and ease of use. It is supported by most programming languages, making it a versatile choice for data interchange. JSON files typically have a `.json` file extension and can be easily read and written using various libraries and tools available in different programming languages.
